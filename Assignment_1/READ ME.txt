Part 1: Javascript Golf Tournament Leaderboard is implemented in golf.js.

	Event Emitter is used to perform postScore() function.

	Let t be the object of Tournament class: 
			var t = new Tournament("{JSON: String}");

	* postScore() function needs to be called as:
			t.play[i].postScore(integer);

	* projectedLeaderboard() function needs to be called as:
			t.projectedLeaderboard(t.projectScoreByHole.bind(t));
